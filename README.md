# Smartlab

This is the code from the Smartlab project. It's super easy to use Wi-Fi to send to the MySQL database. More information on the project as a whole can be found in on my website: https://www.jscblog.com/post/smartlab

The library used can be downloaded from this repository: https://github.com/ChuckBell/MySQL_Connector_Arduino
